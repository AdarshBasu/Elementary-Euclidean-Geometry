# Elementary-Euclidean-Geometry
### Project Title: Formalizing Elementary Euclidean Geometry

1. Defining geometric objects (e.g. points, lines, angles, etc.) and formalizing Euclid's postulates in Lean4 [Ref: Euclid.lean (written in Lean3)]
2. Using the axioms and postulates to prove some theorems encountered in high school geometry. [Ref: NCERT Mathematics Class 9, 10]
3. Tentative topics: theorems on angles, transversal & parallel lines, angle sum property of triangles, congruence of triangles.

We are going to proceed in the same order as it is usually presented in the high school textbooks - building up to more complex theorems from basic theorems.
