### Project Title: Formalizing Elementary Euclidean Geometry And The Path to Desargues' Theorem

1. Defining geometric objects (e.g. points, lines, angles, etc.) and formalizing Euclid's postulates in Lean4 [Ref: Euclid.lean (written in Lean3)]
2. Using the axioms and postulates to prove some theorems encountered in high school geometry. [Ref: NCERT Mathematics Class 9, 10]
3. Tentative topics: theorems on angles, transversal & parallel lines, angle sum property of triangles, congruence of triangles.
4. Shift: We shifted to trying to prove Desargues' theorem. For that, we defined the necessary elements of incidence geometry and their properties. 

We are going to proceed in the same order as it is usually presented in the high school textbooks - building up to more complex theorems from basic theorems.
